# Canvas-Tools

Tools for automating work with the Canvas LMS. General goals:

* Generate Canvas materials from documents under revision control.
* Allow templates.
* Automate repetitive tasks.

Tools with links are under development, bold links are working tools. No link means the tool is in the planning stages, but active development has not started.

* Assignment - create an assignment from a folder which may be under git.
* AutoAnnounce - generate announcements in response to queried criteria.
* [Common](https://github.com/DouglasUrner/Canvas-Tools/tree/master/Common) - shared code.
* CourseGen - generate a course from a git repo.
* [EntryTask](https://github.com/DouglasUrner/Canvas-Tools/tree/master/EntryTask) - generate entry task quizes for a set of sections of a class.
* Page - create an informational page (e.g., class routines).
* Status - generate a list (web page?) sumarizing assignment status for a section.
